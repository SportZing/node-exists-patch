# exists-patch

A two-way patch for Node.js' (fs/path).exists(Sync) functions.

__Note:__ This patch is intended to be a _temporary_ solution until everyone can get up-to-date on this change. It is not meant as a permanent fix so you can ignore the problem. Please update your code...

## Install

```bash
$ npm install exists-patch
```

## Usage

```javascript
var patch = require('exists-patch');

// Coding for a new version (>=0.8) of Node?
// Bring older versions up-to-date to be backward compatable.
patch.patchForward();
fs.exists(...);

// Using a module that isn't up-to-date yet?
// Use the patch to avoid those annoying warning messages or losing
// support when path.exists is removed completely.
patch.patchBackward();
path.exists(...);

// Just want to be thorough without worrying about the specific use-cases?
// Patch both ways!
patch.patch();
```
